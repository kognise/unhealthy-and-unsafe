# Unhealthy and Unsafe

A Beat Saber mod for the Quest that just skips the health and safety screen when the game starts. Nothing else. That dumb and simple. I don't think much else has to be said, really. **Do not use if you want to be healthy or safe!**

Installation: download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/kognise/unhealthy-and-unsafe/releases/latest) and drag it into BMBF.
